                <p>
                  a. By subscribing to the Awwwards directory and using the
                  other services offered by Awwwards, you agree to the current
                  terms and conditions of the site.
                </p>
                <p>b. There are three directory plans available:</p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Basic</strong>: No annual cost. Features include:
                  adding your profile to one directory in one country.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Professional</strong>: Annual cost of €150 ($165).
                  Features include: adding your profile to 3 categories in one
                  country.

                  c. You can opt to upgrade or downgrade your service agreement
                  to any other contract agreement that Awwwards is currently
                  offering for sale at any time during your contract term. In
                  the event of a contract downgrade, a discount credit will be
                  issued to your Awwwards account for the difference in the cost
                  of the two contracts over the remainder of your original
                  contract term. This credit can be applied to future months of
                  service with Awwwards, and is in no way transferable to a cash
                  refund.

                <p>
                  d. At the end of the contract term, your contract will
                  automatically renew for an additional contract term until
                  explicitly cancelled by you. Cancellation must be issued via
                  your user panel or via Awwwards customer support. Any
                  cancellation issued via your user panel must be completed at
                  least one (1) working day prior to the end of the contract
                  term. Any cancellation carried out via Awwwards customer
                  support must be carried out at least three (3) working days
                  prior to the end of the contract term to allow for adequate
                  processing time.
